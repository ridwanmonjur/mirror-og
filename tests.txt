bracket 1.0
1. 2 grids - DONE 
2. dotted finals and ?? - DONE
3. hover
4. finals
5. winner crown

bracket 1.2
1. for reporters box is blue with thicker dotted line, larger font, and a tooltip that is always above it saying
2. constrict space and mobile view

functionality
1. all boxes with lines leading to them will have reporting function available (initial roster lineup and L1-L4 have no reporting function since they will report on U1-U4 instead and the losers will automatically fall to L1-L4 based on results for U1-U4)
2. hover tooltip as usual but clicking does nothing
3. reporting popup does not appear until reporting is open or has ended (meaning, clicking on a bracket box does nothing if the match is upcoming)
(self note for future: next set of matches for that team will have unique popup when clicked saying reporting not open yet pls wait until dd/mm/yy)

bracket 1.3
added 12h duration for organisers to settle ties/disputes

added ui for default states
0-0 no reports
1-1 no disputes

0-0 no reports
1. both teams disqualified/ neither team moves onto next stage in the bracket
2. next box in the bracket will have no team because neither team moved on (grey out the box and put a white x in it)
the team that plays against an empty box in the bracket will be awarded default win

1-1 no disputes
1 (same as before). organiser has 12h to choose a winner (organiser has no way to observe matches, how they choose is completely their prerogative)
if organiser doesnt choose by the time the 12h is up, the system will randomly choose one team as the winner
delay by maximum 12h to give organiser time to respond (special case for when players are extra afk and dont play their tiebreaker match)
next match will start immediately after winner is chosen by organiser, so if organiser responds sooner then it won't be delayed as much
but the delay caps out at 12h at which point the system will just auto choose one team at random as the winner
unfortunately this will have to cut into the reporting window for the next match, meaning the next match may suffer a reporting window duration penalty of up to 12h even if its not their fault
its not ideal but its the best solution we have until we find something better

disputes:
they have until the end of that reporting window to settle the dispute, no delays no exceptions
if the reporting window ends and it hasnt settled, organise gets 12h to choose
if 12h ends and organiser doesnt choose, system will auto random
message is same regardless of if organiser chooses or system auto randoms

organiser response page
use placeholder ui doesnt matter
in this case, we're the organiser so it doesnt have to be pretty since only we will be seeing it. just make it functional doesnt matter how. we'll worry about making something presentable another time


1) Timer done
2) Waiting for opponent team/ opponent team didnt report
3) or if none, no winner chosen
4) if 0-0 no winner (before deadline) or disqualified (after deadline)
5) if no consensus
